#Forum

is a platform to allow users to post plain text essays. Essays are made up of paragraphs which users can comment on. Essays can (and should!) link to external or internal content. Comments can (and should!) reference other paragraphs with an essay, or to other articles or comments. Making the paragraph, not the full essay, the commentable unit encourages conversations which are on topic and inclusive of source material.
